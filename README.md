## Acknowledgments

I am greatfull for the help given from the teachers in Noroff to get to understand and progress on my studies and getting the tools to be able to make this project. Also to the fellow students, for the chats and encouraging words, those are precious in times of stress and frustration. Also to my family that has shown me patients in my journey to get another career, giving me the space needed to study and work.
